# Django CI Workflow

This repository contains the Continuous Integration (CI) workflow for a Django project. The CI workflow is designed to automate testing, code quality checks, security scanning, and deployment to staging.

## Components

### 1. Linting and Code Formatting

Linting and code formatting are performed using Flake8 and Black.

- **Flake8**: Checks Python code against PEP 8 coding standards and detects violations.
- **Black**: Automatically formats Python code according to PEP 8 standards.

### 2. Code Coverage

Code coverage testing is done using Coverage.py.

- **Coverage.py**: Measures code coverage during Python test execution to identify areas not covered by tests.

### 3. Security Scanning

Security scanning is conducted using Bandit and Safety.

- **Bandit**: Identifies common security issues in Python code.
- **Safety**: Checks installed dependencies for known security vulnerabilities.

### 4. Static Analysis

Static analysis is performed using PyLint and MyPy.

- **PyLint**: Checks Python code for errors, convention violations, and code smells.
- **MyPy**: Static type checker for Python that detects type-related errors.

### 5. Deployment to Staging

After successful testing, the application is deployed to a staging environment.

*Placeholder commands are provided. Replace them with actual deployment commands.*

### 6. Notification and Reporting

Notifications or reports are sent when a build fails.

*Placeholder commands are provided. Replace them with actual notification or reporting mechanisms.*
