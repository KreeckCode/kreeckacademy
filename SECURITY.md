## Reporting a Vulnerability

To ensure the safety of our users and the integrity of our project, we take all security vulnerabilities seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please follow the process outlined below to report it:

### How to Report

1. **Email**: Send an email to [info@kreeck.com](mailto:info@kreeck.com) with the details of the vulnerability. Include the following information:
   - A description of the vulnerability and its impact.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - Any potential fixes or suggestions (if available).

2. **Encryption**: If you prefer, you can encrypt your email using our PGP key, which you can find [here](link-to-pgp-key).

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 24 hours. 
2. **Investigation**: Our security team will investigate the vulnerability and provide an initial assessment within 72 hours.
3. **Updates**: You will receive updates on the status of your report at least every five days during our investigation.
4. **Resolution**: Once the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on a fix and release a security update. You will be notified when the fix is applied and a new version is released.

### After Reporting

- **Accepted Vulnerability**: If your reported vulnerability is accepted, we will credit you with the discovery unless you wish to remain anonymous. We will coordinate a public disclosure date with you to ensure users are protected before details are made public.
- **Declined Vulnerability**: If the vulnerability is not accepted, we will provide you with a detailed explanation.

### Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Please do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a reasonable amount of time to address it.

Your assistance in finding and reporting security vulnerabilities is greatly appreciated and helps us maintain the security and integrity of our project. Thank you for your contributions and commitment to our community.
